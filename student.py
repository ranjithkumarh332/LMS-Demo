Registered at /api/student. Implements the full quiz flow:

  Login -> fetch available assessments -> start assessment ->
  random questions served -> submit answers -> store responses ->
  calculate score -> store result -> display result

Also implements:
  - My Assessments (Upcoming / Completed / Attempted / Pending),
    computed from schedule + cohort (incl. Entry Level) + availability.
  - Assessment Results page: Baseline / Mid / Final + the
    "Assessment Name" dropdown of every assessment the student has
    taken, all from the database.
  - Dynamic graphs (skill radar, category %, overall, trend) for
    this one student.
  - Download Report — generated from real DB values.

        department (when the assessment scopes to them).

        Root-cause note: assessment docs already store an authoritative
        college/department name (resolved server-side at creation time
        via resolve_active_college/resolve_active_department in
        trainer.py / superadmin.py — never trusted from raw client IDs,
        so there's no id-vs-name mismatch here, unlike the quiz bug).
        The actual gap was that nothing on the student-visibility side
        ever read those fields — only cohortTarget was checked — so an
        assessment scoped to one college was visible/attemptable by
        students at every college, as long as cohort matched. A None/
        empty college on the assessment means "all colleges" (this is
        the documented behavior in superadmin.create_assessment); a
        college with no department means "all departments in that
        college". Department is only meaningful once college is scoped,
        matching the creation form's own nested logic.

        Null-safety (spec: "Validate Existing Database... handle null
        safely"): an assessment created before cohortTarget existed, or
        with it unset for any other reason, is treated as "all" — the
        same default quiz_module's eligibility check already used — so a
        missing field hides the assessment from nobody instead of hiding
        it from every Cohort A/B/C student (only Entry Level students,
        who have no `cohort` value, would previously have been able to
        see it — an accidental near-total-hide rather than a deliberate
